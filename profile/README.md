# Team Crystalline 💎
A group of people who want to make stuff together with the understanding that the stuff we make is not for profit. Anyone is welcome to join the team, regardless of skill level. Let's learn together!

## Contributing
You don't have to be a programmer to be able to contribute to our projects! Some of these projects need writers, designers, and translators.
- Check out our repositories
- Open an issue if you've encountered bugs or have a feature request for a project.
- Create pull requests if you have assets, code or something else to contribute. **It's recommended that all Team Crystalline projects protect the main branch and require at least 1 review of the pull request before it can be merged.**
- In the future, we might open a Discord server to help manage discussion for each project.
